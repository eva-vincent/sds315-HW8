# Statistical Modeling & Elasticity Analysis
## Overview
This repository contains statistical analyses demonstrating linear and non-linear regression techniques using R. The projects focus on applying mathematical models—specifically linear regression, exponential growth models, and power laws—to interpret trends in biological, epidemiological, and economic data.

## Key Analyses
Biostatistics (Creatinine Clearance): Utilized linear regression to predict kidney function decline with age and performed residual analysis to compare individual health metrics against population averages.

Epidemiology (COVID-19 Growth): modeled the early exponential spread of the virus in Italy and Spain using log-linear regression to estimate growth rates and doubling times with bootstrapped confidence intervals.

Economic Elasticity (Milk Demand): Applied a power law model (log-log regression) to estimate the price elasticity of demand for milk, quantifying consumer sensitivity to price changes.
